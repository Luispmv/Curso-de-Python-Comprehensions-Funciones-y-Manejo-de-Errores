¡Claro! Aquí tienes un dato interesante:
Did you know that honey never spoils? Archaeologists 
have discovered pots of honey in ancient Egyptian
tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still
perfectly edible! Honey's low moisture content and
acidic pH create an inhospitable environment for
bacteria and microorganisms, allowing it to last
indefinitely under the right conditions.
